# Intel 8080 Microprocessor Emulator
## Project Scope
The objective of this project is to build a functional intel 8080 emulator that is capable of running an original Space Invaders ROM. This project is for educational purposes only.
## Features
### Disassembler
The disassembler is a fundamental piece of the overall emulation process. It's role is to decipher machine code into a readable assembly language format based on the intel 8080 instruction set. This tool is crucial for not only learning the instruction set, but for debugging during the emulator build process as well.
